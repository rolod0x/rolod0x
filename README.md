## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

<img src="./docs/images/phone-unknown-number-calling.png" align="right" width="200"
     alt="Smart phone with unknown number calling" />

Would you buy a phone which didn't have an address book feature?  Of course
not - that would be ridiculous!  You'd never know who was calling you, and
making phone calls would be painful.

What about a phone which had an address book but required you to publish all
the entries so that the whole world could see them?  Of course not - that
would be a massive privacy violation!

**So why accept anything less when using web3 and blockchains?**

Well, you don't have to any longer!  rolod0x is a free cross-browser
extension providing **a totally private onchain address book which instantly
makes every web3 website more usable and all your addresses more
accessible.**

For example, take:
[this randomly-picked transaction on etherscan][random-tx]:

![etherscan transaction without rolod0x](docs/images/etherscan-example-before.png)

After labelling the From and To addresses in rolod0x, it now looks like this:

![etherscan transaction with rolod0x](docs/images/etherscan-example-after.png)

Not only that, but whenever these addresses appear on _any other website_,
they will now be labelled in this human-readable way!

[random-tx]: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1e2a4312f7d48efd29ed5dbcca6cabae30214ea895ab54c9b789860cbe8d31dd

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- [Completely free and Open Source!](#license)
- Completely private local-only web3 address book.
- Automatically translates blockchain addresses to human-readable labels.

- Works on any website.
- Works on any EVM-based blockchain and Solana (and could easily support other
  chains in the future).
- Should work on Chrome, Chromium, Brave, or any other browser in the Chrome family.

- Named using [a triple pun](./docs/FAQ.md#name).

## Thanks <a name="thanks"></a>

Thanks to all contributors.  Some special mentions:

- [`@fregante`](https://github.com/fregante/) for all his great npm modules,
  several of which are used by rolod0x.

- [`@jonghakseo`](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/) for
  <https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite> which was
  a great starting point for a React-based MV3 extension.

- Miles Essex for some fantastic design work which freed up my time to
  focus on technical work.  Check out his exciting project
  [Rails](https://rails.run) which generates dynamic, interactive maps
  visualising DeFi transactions!

- The awesome team at my startup [Toucan](https://toucan.earth) for
  being early beta testers and encouraging me to keep working on this
  project.  In particular, thanks to [Alex Haase](https://twitter.com/herrhaase)
  for brainstorming with me and coming up with the perfect name!

- [Dalton Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/) and
  [Canonical](https://canonical.com/) for [the Ubuntu
  font](https://design.ubuntu.com/font) whose `0x` gave me the
  inspiration for the logo.

- [ricmoo](https://www.ricmoo.com/) for the wonderful
  [ethers](https://ethers.org/) Javascript library.

license][expat], and formerly on
